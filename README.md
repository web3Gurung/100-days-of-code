0. Start Date : 03 July, '24.
1.  Commit to the [Log](log.md) and add link to what I did OR add notes.
2.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**
3.  Post my progress weekly (sunday) on X, FC and Li.

I am allowed to miss one day (then make it up by adding one more day to the end of the 100), but to **never** miss two days in a row.
