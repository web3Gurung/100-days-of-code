# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 03 '24, Wed

**Today's Progress**: completed till 37% of The Odin project's Foundations Course.

**Thoughts:** It's computer, internet, and html basics so far. Some of the concepts were new to me, like using <strong> instead of <b> for web accessibility. I think it's going to be more difficult from tomorrow (?)

**Link to work:**
1. [blog](day1/blog.html) - practising html tags

### Day 1: July 04 '24, Thur

**Today's Progress**: Completed till 45% of course. Learnt about rel="noopener noreferrer" and the security implications it had from [owasp](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing) website. Coded a bit today with plain html only -> lists, links and images.

**Thoughts:** Learnt a lot more about html and its tags by making the recipe website.
