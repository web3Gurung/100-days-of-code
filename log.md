# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 03 '24, Wed

**Today's Progress**: completed till 37% of The Odin project's Foundations Course.

**Thoughts:** It's computer, internet, and html basics so far. Some of the concepts were new to me, like using <strong> instead of <b> for web accessibility. I think it's going to be more difficult from tomorrow (?)
